    steps:
    # 1. Check out your code (download it to the VM)
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # 2. Setup .NET (Ensure the VM has .NET 8 or whichever version you use)

    # 3. Restore Dependencies (Nuget packages)
    - name: Restore dependencies
      run: dotnet restore

    # 4. Build the Project in Release Mode
    # --no-restore makes it faster since we just did it
    - name: Build
      run: dotnet build --configuration Release --no-restore

    # 5. Upload the DLL as an "Artifact"
    # This takes the file from the VM and saves it to your GitHub Actions tab
